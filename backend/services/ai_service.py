üéØ TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

üìÑ CURRENT RESUME:
{resume_json}

üöÄ TRANSFORMATION INSTRUCTIONS (BE VERY AGGRESSIVE):

1. **SUMMARY - COMPLETE REWRITE**:
   - Write a compelling summary that mirrors the job requirements EXACTLY
   - Use keywords from the job description heavily
   - Position the candidate as an expert in what the job needs
   - Make it sound like this job was made for them

2. **SKILLS - ADD WHAT'S MISSING**:
   - Extract ALL technical skills, tools, frameworks, and methodologies from the job description
   - ADD these skills to the resume even if they're not currently listed
   - Reorganize skills to put job-relevant ones FIRST
   - Create skill categories that match the job requirements
   - Include specific versions, certifications, or proficiency levels mentioned in the job
   - If the job mentions "AWS, Docker, Kubernetes" - ADD THEM to skills
   - If the job mentions "Agile, Scrum, CI/CD" - ADD THEM to skills
   - Be comprehensive - add everything the job asks for

3. **EXPERIENCE - AGGRESSIVE REWRITING**:
   - REWRITE each experience bullet to highlight aspects relevant to this job
   - ADD quantified achievements (percentages, numbers, metrics) that sound impressive
   - Use action verbs that match the job description (led, architected, optimized, implemented, etc.)
   - Emphasize technologies and methodologies mentioned in the job
   - If the job needs "Python", make sure Python is mentioned in multiple experience bullets
   - If the job needs "team leadership", add bullets about leading teams/projects
   - Transform generic bullets into specific, impressive achievements
   - Example transformation:
     - Before: "Worked on web applications"
     - After: "Architected and deployed scalable microservices handling 50K+ daily users, reducing response time by 40% using Docker and Kubernetes"

4. **EDUCATION - ENHANCE IF NEEDED**:
   - Highlight relevant coursework matching the job
   - Add relevant projects or thesis topics
   - Mention honors or achievements if applicable

5. **KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION FOR ATS**:
   - Ensure EVERY major keyword from the job description appears in the resume
   - Use exact phrases from the job description when possible
   - Include acronyms AND full terms (e.g., "CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)")

6. **MAKE THE MATCH SCORE HIGH**:
   - Your goal is to achieve a match score of 90-100%
   - This resume should look like it was written FOR this specific job

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES:
- Keep the same employment timeline (dates, companies, positions)
- Keep the education institutions and degrees
- Don't fabricate entire new jobs or degrees
- BUT you CAN and SHOULD:
  ‚úì ADD skills from the job description
  ‚úì REWRITE experience bullets to emphasize relevant work
  ‚úì ADD quantified achievements and metrics
  ‚úì TRANSFORM how experiences are described
  ‚úì Make the candidate sound like an expert in what the job needs

üö® CRITICAL - YOU MUST RETURN THESE FIELDS:
- "matchScore": Calculate a realistic match percentage (0-100) based on how well the optimized resume matches the job
- "matchedKeywords": Extract ALL important keywords from the job description that now appear in the optimized resume (minimum 10 keywords)
