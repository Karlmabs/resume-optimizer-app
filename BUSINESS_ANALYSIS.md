### Critical Issues to Correct

#### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY

1. **No User Authentication**
   - **Problem**: Users lose all data when they close the browser
   - **Impact**: Zero user retention, no repeat customers
   - **Customer Pain**: "I spent 30 minutes building my resume and lost everything"
   - **Fix**: Implement authentication (Auth0, Clerk, or NextAuth)

2. **No Resume History/Versioning**
   - **Problem**: Users can't save multiple resume versions
   - **Impact**: Limited value for customers targeting multiple jobs
   - **Customer Pain**: "I need different resumes for different job types"
   - **Fix**: Add resume library with version management

3. **PDF Export Missing**
   - **Problem**: Users can only download Markdown/TXT
   - **Impact**: Major friction - users need PDF for actual applications
   - **Customer Pain**: "I can't actually apply to jobs with this output"
   - **Fix**: Add professional PDF export with multiple templates

4. **No Pricing/Monetization Model**
   - **Problem**: Burning API costs with no revenue
   - **Impact**: Unsustainable business model
   - **Customer Pain**: N/A - but business can't scale
   - **Fix**: Implement tiered pricing (see Monetization section)

5. **Backend Requires Technical Setup**
   - **Problem**: Users need to install Python, get OpenAI API key, run backend
   - **Impact**: 95% of potential users will never use the product
   - **Customer Pain**: "This is too complicated to set up"
   - **Fix**: Deploy backend to cloud, provide hosted solution

#### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

6. **No Email Collection**
   - **Problem**: Can't build email list or nurture leads
   - **Impact**: No marketing channel for updates/features
   - **Fix**: Add email capture before allowing full feature access

7. **Limited Analytics**
   - **Problem**: No understanding of user behavior
   - **Impact**: Can't optimize conversion or identify drop-off points
   - **Fix**: Implement analytics (PostHog, Mixpanel, or GA4)

8. **No Social Proof**
   - **Problem**: No testimonials, success stories, or stats
   - **Impact**: Users don't trust the product quality
   - **Fix**: Add testimonials, success metrics, before/after examples

9. **Generic Cover Letters**
   - **Problem**: Cover letters may feel templated
   - **Impact**: Users might not find them valuable
   - **Fix**: Add more personalization parameters (company research, role details)

10. **No ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization**
    - **Problem**: Many resumes get filtered by ATS before human review
    - **Impact**: Users may not get interview callbacks
    - **Customer Pain**: "My resume isn't getting past automated filters"
    - **Fix**: Add ATS compatibility checker and optimization

#### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Polish)

11. **No Mobile Optimization for Builder**
    - The multi-step builder is functional but could be better on mobile

12. **Limited Template Options**
    - Only one output format/style currently

13. **No Collaboration Features**
    - Can't share resume for feedback from friends/mentors

14. **No Tutorial/Onboarding**
    - First-time users may be confused about the flow
